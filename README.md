WIP - Planning to move dataset to Google Cloud Storage and training from Google Colab to larger machine learning platform.

*Abstract -* **Access to clean and safe water is a basic human need and is essential for any community to thrive. Contamination detection plays an important role in monitoring this vital resource to maintain the water quality and make necessary adjustments during water treatment. Traditionally, laboratory testing is responsible for detecting dangerous pollutants and changes in the water. However, infrequent sampling, testing, and the time consumed waiting for laboratory results can lead to drops in water quality before treatment is adjusted. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using a deep learning on satellite images to predict common parameters in assessing water quality. We explore using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on harmonized Sentinel-2 satellite images of bodies of water obtained from Google Earth Engine (GEE) to accurately evaluate water quality. The DCNN model extracts features from 12 bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images and predicts the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of the water bodies in the image. We evaluate the model using BOD5 data on the water bodies provided by the Global River Quality Archive (GRQA).**
